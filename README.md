# android-proxy-server
This is part of RnD work to inject traffic of one network inside another netowkr in Android.
This is only server part. Traffic can be forwarded using Proxy config of WiFi netowkr locally, overall JVM config, VPN service etc.
Work is inspired from other projects, Java proxy configuration, Android proxy support specifications.
